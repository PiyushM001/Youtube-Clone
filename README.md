in this project i have youyube clone using react and axios for api data fetching .
the main aim for this project was to get data from api and use it to show components on my web page . i did not add much css in this because learning css and writing it for hours was not my aim for that project so i kept it as simple as a navbar where we can search and a result section where videos are displayed corresponding to our search .
